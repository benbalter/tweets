Ever need to create "welcome" or "thank you" slides with a bunch of avatars for your all hands or similar team meetings? I do, frequently enough that I created https://github.com/benbalter/avatar-montage to automate the process.

Special thanks to @martinwoodward &amp; @jhutchings0 for their prior art.
