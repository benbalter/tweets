@gjtorikian Different vibe, but last year @briandoll introduced me to Above and Beyond Group Therapy (ABGT) via https://briandoll.medium.com/personal-setup-for-getting-shit-done-in-2021-b6bdef7ad7f0, which has become a GSD staple.

Fun fact: Alive was the only album I had on iTunes (via Play), so I listened to it on repeat every time I flew out to SF.
