@aidanfeldman Honored and humbled to have been your inspiration! 

There are a few more write ups around the "how and why" listed in https://ben.balter.com/2021/02/01/what-to-read-before-starting-or-interviewing-at-github/, but I suspect "Why everything should have a URL" and "15 rules of communicating" are likely the most relevant.
