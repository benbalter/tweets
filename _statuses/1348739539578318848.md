@lukefretwell @mgifford @MarcoInEnglish @yatil @SteveALee @civicactions I recently ran into this question when working on https://ben.balter.com/2021/01/11/analysis-of-federal-dotgov-domains-pre-biden-edition/. AFAIK you can point a YAML parser at the file and it will read the front matter.

.yml would be more semantic/proper if it's purely data, and not also copy/formatting as it is for GitHub's.
