I wrote an "everything I wish I knew my first week at GitHub" post to a personal-but-internal-to-github blog in 2016 (then my third year at GitHub). I recently republished it mostly unchanged in hopes it could be helpful to future Hubbers and non-Hubbers. https://ben.balter.com/2016/10/31/eight-things-i-wish-i-knew-my-first-week-at-github/
