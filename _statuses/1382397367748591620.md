As gyms closed a year ago, I got a bike to stay active &amp; get outside safely. Nearly 1k miles later, I've stuck to my goal of biking at least 1x/week (including a few not-so-fun 30°F weeks) &amp; discovered parts of DC I didn't know existed. Here's to moar #bikedc in the year to come. https://t.co/tDbWpH1dTl
