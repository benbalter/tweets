@JJJ @jeremyfelt @mor10 Still lots of activity (https://github.com/benbalter/wp-document-revisions/graphs/contributors). We actually test against 5.3 (https://github.com/benbalter/wp-document-revisions/blob/master/.travis.yml)… I can bump the metadata and get a new release up in the plugin directory. Thanks for the @mention!
