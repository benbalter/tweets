@iamsapegin @github It's new and is now available to all users (https://github.blog/changelog/2019-12-11-report-disruptive-content-to-open-source-maintainers/). 

It's off by default because not all maintainers would respond or want to take on the burden. In that case, we'd rather users report spam, etc to GitHub's terms of service team rather than an unmonitored inbox
