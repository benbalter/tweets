@LauraHayesDC Recently got into biking in DC. To keep things interesting &amp; to continue to get out there dispute the DC heat, I set arbitrary goals for myself (https://github.com/benbalter/dc-bike-badges). Great way to explore new parts of the city.

@wirecutter recs have been solid &amp; @WABADC has great resources.
