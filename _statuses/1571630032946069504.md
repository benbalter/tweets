@xor @krusynth Yep! Take a look at https://github.com/benbalter/benbalter.github.com/blob/main/.github/workflows/build-and-deploy.yml, which creates a custom build environment (Jekyll 4) on each push based on my Gemfile (https://github.com/benbalter/benbalter.github.com/blob/main/Gemfile). You can even Dockerize builds locally for even more parity.
