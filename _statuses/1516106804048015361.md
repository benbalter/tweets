@mholt6 @github As a Caddy fan, I'm sorry to hear about your experience. There are a number of more scalable moderation tools beyond deleting (https://docs.github.com/en/communities/moderating-comments-and-conversations), including reporting the user (rather than each comment). But ideally, the spam would be detected before you had to moderate it.
